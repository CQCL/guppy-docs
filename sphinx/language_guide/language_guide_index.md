# Guppy Language Guide

Welcome to the Guppy Language Guide. This guide is intended to provide a step by step walkthrough of the major features of the Guppy programming language. 
The guide contains explanations of the key Guppy data types, the ownership model, control flow and more. The content will be expanded and improved as more features become available.

If you're brand new to Guppy, check out our [getting started guide](../getting_started.md) to install Guppy and start writing your first programs. There is also a [gallery of example programs](../examples_index.md) showcasing various quantum algorithms implemented in Guppy.
