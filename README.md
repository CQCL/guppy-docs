# Guppy Documentation

This repository contains documentation for the Guppy programming language.

## Contents
* The Guppy language guide
* The Guppy landing page
* The API documentation for the guppylang package
* FAQs, changelog and migration guides
* The guppylang [example notebooks](https://github.com/CQCL/guppylang/tree/main/examples) (included via the guppylang submodule)

## Building the docs locally

Requirements:
* The [just command runner](https://github.com/casey/just) 
* Sphinx docs -> [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

See the `devenv.nix` file.

First clone the repository making sure to checkout the [guppylang](https://github.com/CQCL/guppylang) submodule.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:CQCL/guppy-docs.git --recurse-submodules
```

Alternatively you can update the submodules if you have already cloned the repository.

```shell
git submodule update --init
```
Next run the build with `just build`. This builds both the Sphinx docs and the landing page

```shell
just build
```

The built html page can be served locally with:

```shell
just serve
```

To clean all of the files generated by the sphinx build:

```shell
just clean
```

To run the build in "debug" mode:

```shell
just build-debug
```

Followed by

```shell
just serve-debug
```

Building the docs in debug mode with `just build-debug` allows sphinx warnings whereas `just build` treats these warnings as errors. Debug mode is useful for debugging issues with the executed Guppy code in the docs.

To check the API docs coverage run:

```shell
just coverage
```

To check all of the links in the Sphinx docs run:

```shell
just link-check
```
